Wanted to say Trudy has raised a question about the very 
promise of the upcoming episodes.  Some copy and 
paste between shows seems genie like.  Walked into   
forest half way, took rte66 back to find
YT as an abbreviation, would you believe, for You Tube! 

#P.S. Did you get my previous cards?  Sent two on the fourth, skip the question though.
